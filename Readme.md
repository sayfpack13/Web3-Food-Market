A web application project that integrates Web3 and MongoDB to manage a decentralized food market. This API provides endpoints to:

- **Create Food:** Add new food items to **Mongodb** and **blockchain network**.
- **Get Food List:** Retrieve a list of all available food items from both **Mongodb** and **blockchain network**.
- **Deploy Food Contract:** Deploy smart contracts related to food management using Web3.

The project leverages MongoDB for persistent storage and Web3 for smart contract interactions, facilitating a decentralized approach to food market management.
